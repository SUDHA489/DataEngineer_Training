Step 1: Peer Review
	I presented my initial star schema data model to my friend.
	Reviewer: Madhu MM
	Feedback:

		The overall design was clear and simple.

		The dimension tables DIM_CUSTOMER and DIM_PRODUCT are well defined and properly cover customer and product attributes.

		The fact table FACT_SALES correctly includes the transaction-level details such as sales_id, customer_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, and order_date.

		The reviewer pointed out that while the keys are clear, I should ensure that customer_id and product_id are set as foreign keys referencing the dimension tables.

		Madhu also suggested that in the future, I could include a DIM_DATE to manage dates in a more flexible way for advanced reporting.

Step 2: Model Refinement
	I verified the keys and relationships:

	I confirmed that sales_id acts as the primary key for FACT_SALES.

	I made sure customer_id in FACT_SALES links to DIM_CUSTOMER and product_id links to DIM_PRODUCT.

	I noted the suggestion for a DIM_DATE dimension, but for this version I kept order_date as a direct column.

Step 3: Validation and Confidence Building
	I shared the refined schema again with Madhu for final feedback.

	The reviewer confirmed that the star schema is now clear, relational links are correct, and the model is ready for use in analysis and reporting.
	
	This gave me more confidence that my design is solid, simple, and follows good star schema principles.
