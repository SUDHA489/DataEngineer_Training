Step 1: Peer Review
	I presented my initial star schema data model to my friend.
	Reviewer: Madhu MM
	Feedback:
		The overall structure was good, but there was a small issue â€” the reviewer pointed out that I missed 		the relationship between FACT_RETURNS and DIM_REGION. They suggested adding this link to keep the 		model complete.

Step 2: Model Refinement
	I carefully checked all the relationships between the fact tables and dimension tables.
	I noticed I had indeed missed connecting FACT_RETURNS to DIM_REGION.
	I fixed this by adding the missing relationship so that every fact table is properly linked to the related 	dimensions.

Step 3: Validation and Confidence Building
	I shared the refined model with my peer for a final check.
	The reviewer confirmed that the updated model looks good now and follows the star schema principles 	correctly.
	This gave me more confidence that my design is clear and complete.
